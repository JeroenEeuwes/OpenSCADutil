# Libraries, modules, or scripts related to OpenSCAD 

This is an individual git repository (not affiliated to [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)) where you will find some some utilities that I create and could potentially be of use to the community.

Each directory contains a small project with its instructions if necessary.
