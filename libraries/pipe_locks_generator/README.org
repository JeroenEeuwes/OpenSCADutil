* Description

This OpenSCAD script generates customizable locking mechanisms for pipes and tubes of various sizes. It includes three main components:

- Fixed base lock
- Threaded collar
- Threaded lid

These parts are designed to seal tubular structures, making them ideal for creating recipients or containers.

* OpenSCAD Customizer

- The *Part selector* menu let you render either the /fixed base lock/, the /threaded collar/ or the /locking lid/.

- The *main dimensions* menu permits to edit the /outer diameter/, the /thickness/, the wished /clereance/ and /thread heigth/.

- The /curled pattern options/ let you modify the depth of the engraved curled pattern. You can also choose to not have any pattern at all.

- The printer settings option lets you select the width of your printer nozzle (default: 0.4). Most importantly, you can define your printer tolerance (default: 0.2).
