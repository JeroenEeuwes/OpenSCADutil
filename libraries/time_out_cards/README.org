* Description

This OpenSCAD script generates customizable time-out cards for handball matches, compliant with official handball rules. Each team (Home and Away) is allowed one time-out per period, including extra time.

The script supports two output formats:

- SVG: For use with vinyl cutters or laser engravers.
- STL: For 3D printing, including multi-color designs and stencils.

* Features

- Fully adjustable card dimensions and layer heights.
  
- Customizable text for:

  1. Period: "1", "2", "3", or "E" (Extra time).
  2. Team: "H" (Home) or "A" (Away)

- Four distinct modules for various use cases:

  - svg: Outline for cutting or engraving.
  - stencil: 3D-printable stencil.
  - card: Complete card with raised text for 3D printing.
  - card_text: Standalone text module for multi-material printing.
   
* Usaage

Cards can be generated interactively using the OpenSCAD customizer or automated through a script to produce an entire set (see the file [[./generate_time_out_cards.sh][generate_time_out_cards.sh]] for an example).

For direct customization via the command line, OpenSCAD parameters can be overridden using the ~-D~ flag:

- selector: Output type (svg, stencil, card, or card_text).
- char_period: Period (1, 2, 3, or E).
- char_team: Team (H or A).
